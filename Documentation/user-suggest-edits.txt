== Author workflow

You can apply one or more suggested edits. When a suggested edit is applied it
creates a change edit that you can further modify in Gerrit. You can read more
about all the features of link:user-inline-edit.html#editing-change[change edit mode].

FYI: Publishing a new patchset in Gerrit will make your Gerrit change out of
sync with your local git commit. You can checkout the latest Gerrit patchset
by using the commands from the link:user-review-ui.html#download[download drop-down panel].

Alternatively, you can use the copy to clipboard button to copy a suggested
edit to your clipboard and then you can paste it into your editor.
