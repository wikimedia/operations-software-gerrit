community and where any contribution is very welcome.

implementing it, just assign the corresponding issue to yourself and

=== Creating Help Wanted issues

Issues on the link:https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/hotlists/5395287[HelpWanted,role=external,window=_blank]
hotlist should be phrased as user stories and be well-scoped so that they can
be easily picked up by new contributors:

* The issue title should name the feature and be prefixed with a t-shirt size
  in square brackets to indicate the expected effort.
* The issue description should use Markdown and have the following sections:
** *User Story*: Explain the use case that is being addressed and what's the
   value of the feature.
** *What*: Describe what should be done.
** *Background*: Any useful background information, including ideas how the
   feature can be done.
** *Pointers*: Useful links to documentation and code

Note, only link:dev-roles.html#maintainer[maintainers] and
link:dev-roles.html#contributor[trusted contributors] can add issues to the `HelpWanted` hotlist.
